# Computational Physics Final Project Proposal

1. Select a topic by [coordinating with your group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O16vAUVFH1HswU8cDSWhX64df1tGc6MBhEAng7Doi5Y/edit?usp=sharing). The project rubric, suggested scope, and past examples can be found [on the course website.](https://www.wgilpin.com/cphy/project)

2. Create an empty GitHub repository for your project. If you are new to GitHub, we provide instructions [here](https://www.wgilpin.com/howto/howto_github.html). However, you are free to use a different tooling method, or use the GitHub online GUI, if you prefer.

3. Write a `README.md` file for your project, and commit it to the repository. The README should contain the following information:
    - The title of the project.
    - A 1-2 sentence description of the project. What is the problem you are solving, and what is the main idea of your solution?
    - A list of the planned directory structure of the project. For example, many projects might use a top-level `demo.ipynb` file that shows a minimal example of the project working, and then call a subdirectory `src/project_name.py` that contains the main code implementation. Some projects might have a `data` directory that contains the data files needed to run the project, or a `results` directory that contains the results of the project. What you include here entirely up to you and your project, the goal here is to make sure you have a plan for the project's components and structure and how to break them apart into manageable pieces.
    - 2-5 bullet points describing the planned chronological steps to complete the project, including the main code you plan to write, what other implementations are available if you plan to build on top of them, and what other components you plan to add.
    - A 1-2 sentence description of the planned contributions of each team member.
    - Any additional notes, references, or information that you think is relevant to the project and necessary for someone else to understand your project.
    - You can change all of this later, the README at this stage is so that the course staff can understand your project and give you feedback on your plan, if needed.

4. Post a link to your project topic, and a link to the GitHub repository [below your group name in the projects roster here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O16vAUVFH1HswU8cDSWhX64df1tGc6MBhEAng7Doi5Y/edit?usp=sharing)
