Formatting: Formatting Python code involves making changes that improve readability to human users, rather than changing its underlying structure. Here we aren’t focusing on refactoring code, in which we change the logic of the program itself in order to make the code easier to extend, troubleshoot, or modify, although refactoring can certainly help with human readability. Python has a strong set of conventions regarding formatting, PEP-8, which can help 

We’ve seen that whitespace in Python has meaning: Code written without proper indentation within loops, for example, will fail to run.
