    "# About Jupyter and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Jupyter Notebooks as the development environment for this book. Unlike raw python scripts `.py`, Jupyter Notebooks allow us to mix code, text, and visualizations in a single document, similar to a Mathematica notebook. A few key things to know about Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kernel.** The Jupyter Notebook is a client-server application. The server is the \"kernel\", which is responsible for executing the code. The client is the notebook interface, which allows you to write code, text, and visualizations in a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Order of execution.** Code in Jupyter Notebooks is executed cell by cell. This means that you can run a cell multiple times without having to re-run the entire notebook. Once a cell is run, the output is displayed inline with the code. Any variables defined in a cell are available for the duration of the session unless otherwise specified. Unlike raw python scripts, the order of execution is important, but not the order in which cells appear in the notebook. Once the notebook is retarted, all variables are reset, and only the text within cells (the code itself that sets variables) remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Magic commands.** Magic commands are special commands that start with a `%` that modify the behavior of the notebook. For example, `%matplotlib inline` tells the notebook to display matplotlib plots inline. These are *not* standard Python commands and they will cause errors if used in a `.py` file.\n",

    "\n",
    "I also import the Python plotting library `matplotlib`, and set the `%matplotlib inline` magic command, which tells the notebook to display matplotlib plots inline in the notebook, rather than opening a new window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I load a Jupyter extension, `autoreload`, which tells the notebook to reload imported modules whenever the notebook is run. This is useful if you are developing code in a separate file and then importing it to the notebook, and you want to test the effects of your changes without restarting the notebook and kernel."

    "# Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become one of the most popular and flexible languages for scientific computing because it is an **interpreted language**, which makes experimentation and prototyping fast and interactive. It is also highly extensible, with a vast ecosystem of external modules that can be imported for numerical analysis, symbolic mathematics, data visualization, parallel computing, and machine learning. This flexibility allows developers to move quickly from ideas to implementation without getting bogged down in low-level details or implementing their own versions of common tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other strong options for computational physics include C and C++, which remain unmatched for performance-critical applications where fine-grained control over memory and hardware is essential, and Mathematica, which is particularly powerful for symbolic manipulation, algebraic computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we are using Python, it is worth keeping an eye on newer and evolving languages for scientific computing such as Julia, which aims to combine the ease of Python with the speed of C. As a newer language than Python, Julia aims to combine the accessibility of a high-level dynamic language like Python while achieving performance closer to C, thanks to just-in-time (JIT) compilation. Julia also offers native linear algebra and parallelism. Rust a new compiled language aiming to replace C and potentially Fortran in many settings. It provides low-level performance comparable to C and C++, but with a strong focus on memory safety and concurrency guarantees enforced at compile time. Its ownership and borrowing system eliminates entire classes of bugs (like data races and segmentation faults), making it especially appealing for high-performance computing where reliability is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several specialized languages and environments are tailored to particular domains of scientific computing: R is widely used in statistics; MATLAB remains a standard in engineering and applied mathematics, especially for signal processing and control system design; and Perl, though less common today, still sees use in text processing and legacy bioinformatics pipelines."
